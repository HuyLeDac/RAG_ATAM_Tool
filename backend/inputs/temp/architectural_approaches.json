{"architecturalApproaches": [{"approach": "Monolithic Architecture", "description": "A monolithic architecture consolidates all functionalities\u2014user interface, business logic,\nand data operations\u2014into a single, tightly integrated application. It is built as one de-\nployable unit, facilitating straightforward development, deployment, and scaling on cloud\ninfrastructure. This architecture is suitable for an online store aiming for operational\nefficiency and reliable performance under predictable loads.", "architectural decisions": ["Unified Codebase and Deployment: Develop the application as a single project using React for the front end and Spring Boot for the back end. Enable horizontal scaling with a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer) to distribute traffic during high-demand periods such as Black Friday", "Database Management: Implement a centralized relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) to manage data for users, products, orders, and payments. Use read replicas to handle heavy read workloads and implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data like product listings or user profiles."], "architectural views": [{"view":
