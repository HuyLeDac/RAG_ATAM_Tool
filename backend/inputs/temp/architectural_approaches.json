{"architecturalApproaches": [{"approach": "Microservices Architecture", "description": "In the microservices architecture, the system is divided into multiple small, independent services, each focusing on a specific functionality, such as user management, product catalog, or order processing. These services communicate with each other through lightweight protocols (e.g., REST or messaging systems like Kafka). This architecture enhances scalability, flexibility, and fault isolation.", "architectural decisions": ["Service Separation: Each microservice is responsible for a distinct domain, such as user management, product catalog, order processing, payment handling, and inventory tracking, ensuring modularity and maintainability.", "Infrastructure & Deployment: Services are containerized with Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes (K8s) for scalability, self-healing, and load balancing, with an API Gateway managing request routing.", "Communication & Integration: REST APIs handle synchronous client interactions, while Apache Kafka enables asynchronous event-driven messaging, and each service maintains its own dedicated database for autonomy.", "Scalability & Security: Horizontal scaling allows services to scale independently, OAuth 2.0 and RBAC secure APIs, and a service mesh (Istio) enhances observability, traffic control, and security enforcement."], "architectural views":
