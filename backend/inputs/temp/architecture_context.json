{"architectureDescription": {"systemPurpose": "The traffic flow simulation program is designed to help students learn about traffic signal timing and its impact on traffic flow. It aims to visualize the effects of different signal timing schemes on traffic flow in an area with multiple intersections. The system provides an interactive platform where students can design road maps, set traffic signal timings, and simulate traffic flows, adjusting parameters like traffic density to observe how changes affect overall traffic behavior.", "technicalConstraints": ["The simulation must allow students to create a visual map of an area with roads and intersections of varying complexity.", "The system must support the design and configuration of traffic light behavior, with various timing schemes, including left-turn arrows and sensor-triggered signal changes.", "Real-time simulation of traffic flow must be visualized, with updates reflecting changes in traffic signal timing and density.", "The system should allow students to adjust traffic density and view the results in real-time, with appropriate error handling to avoid unrealistic configurations such as crash-inducing signal combinations.", "The program must be user-friendly, encouraging students to experiment with different designs and timing schemes without requiring deep technical knowledge."], "systemInteractions": ["Allows students to create a visual map with roads and intersections, placing them in a configuration of their choosing.", "Lets students design the behavior of traffic signals at each intersection, including timing schemes and sensor-triggered adjustments.", "Simulates traffic flow in real-time, updating the state of traffic lights and vehicles as the simulation runs.", "Provides visual feedback on the status of each intersection\u2019s lights and the flow of traffic, enabling students to observe the impact of their timing decisions.", "Allows students to adjust the traffic density for different roads and see how it affects the overall simulation.", "Prevents the creation of traffic signal configurations that could lead to accidents, with the system flagging invalid signal combinations."]}}
