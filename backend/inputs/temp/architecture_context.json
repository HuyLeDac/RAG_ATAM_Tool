{"architectureDescription": {"systemPurpose": "Generate an optimized architecture and operational strategy for an online store that supports high-volume concurrent users, ensures a seamless customer experience during peak traffic events (e.g., Black Friday), and maintains reliable inventory and order management. Consider scalability, performance optimization, fault tolerance, and efficient database design in your response.", "technicalConstraints": ["Design an optimized system architecture for an online store that supports high-volume concurrent users, ensures a seamless customer experience during peak traffic (e.g., Black Friday), and provides reliable inventory and order management. The system must integrate with third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), expose APIs for external inventory management systems, and support user interactions for browsing, purchasing, and reviewing products. Additionally, the solution must be built using React for the front end and Spring Boot for the back end, and must be hosted on a cloud infrastructure such as AWS or Azure. Consider scalability, fault tolerance, performance optimization, and secure transactions in your response."], "systemInteractions": ["Design a scalable online store using React (front end) and Spring Boot (back end), hosted on AWS or Azure.
